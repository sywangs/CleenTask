I upload 2 greddy algorithm,one is common greddy and another one is a optimized version.The way I optimized is before going to next recursion,I change the W,H which is alwayss to be setted smaller than his dad,I trid to find a more reasonalble one.For details we can have a simple disscussion.And I feel sorry for I can't make sure it works very well in too many occusions,I did't do test enough cause it's really too late.Things I can ensure is it works well in my lap and even better than your examples in requirement.I am going to upload 2 screenshoot to prove what I said.
